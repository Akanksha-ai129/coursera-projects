          <p>A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. 
            A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted . 
            In Euclidean geometry any three points, when non-collinear, determine a unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane

          <p>A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently
            it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant.

              <h4>Square</h4>
          </div>

          <p>In geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, or (100-gradian angles or right angles).
            It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length. </p>
